Personal Communicator-Copilot: An AI assistant for calls and texts.


# 📱 Quell AI  
**Calm your calls, tame your texts.**  
An open-source, privacy-first AI copilot that auto-attends calls and texts on your behalf, filters spam, and summarizes conversations you can actually trust.

---

## 🌟 Features
- **Copilot Mode** — like silent/vibrate mode, but smarter. Toggle AI ON/OFF or set it for a duration (e.g., 1 hour).  
- **Instruction Feed** — short-lived tasks the AI can use, auto-cleared after a week (privacy by design).  
- **Whitelist Contacts** — important calls/texts bypass AI entirely.  
- **Spam Filtering** — block spammers using number reputation + keyword filters.  
- **Mind-Map Summaries** — conversations distilled into key-point visuals/snippets.  
- **Voice Cloning (opt-in)** — Quell AI speaks in your voice but always discloses itself.  
- **Searchable Transcripts** — find keywords across calls and texts.  
- **Weekly Reports** — overview of AI-handled calls, spam blocked, time saved.  
- **Open-Source & Modular** — bring-your-own-provider keys (STT, TTS, telephony).
